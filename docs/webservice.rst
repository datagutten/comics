***********
Web service
***********

*comics* comes with a web service that exposes all useful data about the
current user, comics, comic releases, and comic images. The web service may be
used to e.g. create iOS/Android apps or alternative comics browsers, while
leaving the comics crawling job to a *comics* instance.

Please make any apps using this API generic, so that they can be used with any
*comics* instance as the backend. In other words, please let the end user
enter the hostname of the *comics* instance himself.


Authentication
==============

The web service is only available for users with an active user account on the
*comics* instance. The user must authenticate himself using the same
secret key as is used to access comic feeds. The secret key can be provided in
one of two ways:

- Using a HTTP GET parameter named ``key``, i.e. as part of the URL. Example:
  http://example.com/api/v1/user/?key=76acdcdf16ae4e12becb00d09a9d9456

- Using the ``Authorization`` HTTP header. Example: ``Authorization: Key
  76acdcdf16ae4e12becb00d09a9d9456``


Response format
===============

You can specify the wanted response format in one of two ways:

- Using a HTTP GET parameter named ``format``, i.e. as part of the URL.
  Example: http://example.com/api/v1/?format=json

- Using the ``Accept`` HTTP header. Example:: ``Accept: application/json``

JSON and JSONP is always supported. Other formats like XML, YAML, and Apple
binary plists (bplist) may be available if the *comics* instance got the
additional dependencies required by the format installed.

If you run a *comics* instance yourself, and want support for more response
formats, check out `Tastypie's serialization docs
<http://django-tastypie.readthedocs.org/en/latest/serialization.html>`_ for
details on what you need to install.
